# Blurb - The Modern NewsBlur Client

## What is Blurb?
(Links to Google Play Store listing forthcoming.)

Blurb is a third-party client for the RSS Reader service Newsblur. It takes advantage of modern tools and modern Material Design language to create a smooth experience. It's open-source, free to download, and will always be ad-free. (NewsBlur's API expressly forbids selling ads alongside the data it provides.)

## Compiling Blurb for Yourself
Blurb uses Firebase for (optional) analytics, including Firebase's Crashlytics. A google-services.json is not included in the source code. For this reason, a Firebase account is required. Head to [your Firebase dashboard](https://firebase.google.com), and follow the wizard's instructions for creating an Android project. Download the google-services.json file generated for your project and insert it in the root of /blurb/blurb.
